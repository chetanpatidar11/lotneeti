# Planner_v2_Test_Matrix

LotNeeti Planner v2 Test Matrix

Functional, edge-case and regression scenarios

Draft for implementation review • Version 2.0

# How to use this matrix

Implement these as automated domain/service tests before relying on the planner for real IPO operations. P0 tests block beta release. P1 tests should pass before invitation beta. P2 tests cover robustness, usability and future regression protection.

| Golden tests: In addition to the generic cases below, create 15–25 historical snapshots from the founder’s actual 17-PAN workflow and freeze the agreed expected output for each one. |

# Quote & Category

| ID | Scenario | Key setup | Expected result | Pri |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QC-001 | Retail quote is one lot | Upper price ₹100, lot 150 | Retail amount = ₹15,000; lots = 1. | P0 |
| QC-002 | Minimum sHNI exact math | One lot ₹15,000 | floor(₹2L/₹15k)+1 = 14 lots = ₹2.10L. | P0 |
| QC-003 | sHNI when one lot already above ₹2L | One lot ₹2.25L | Minimum sHNI = 1 lot = ₹2.25L. | P0 |
| QC-004 | Do not top up automatic sHNI | Minimum valid sHNI ₹2.10L; bank has ₹5L | Automatic row remains ₹2.10L unless user changes lots. | P0 |
| QC-005 | Retail/sHNI exclusivity | Same PAN/IPO has existing Retail row | Planner cannot create second sHNI row; upgrade replaces category. | P0 |
| QC-006 | Retail Only mode | IPO set Retail Only; ample funds | All automatic rows remain Retail. | P0 |
| QC-007 | sHNI Preferred max-count | 10 PAN; example capital permits 3 upgrades | Result 3 minimum sHNI + 7 Retail if wallets feasible. | P0 |
| QC-008 | Custom category preserved | User fixes PAN A to sHNI and PAN B Retail | Planner keeps those categories and only maps funding. | P0 |

# Golden historical scenario template

Create one record per historical IPO planning day that you know well. These tests are more valuable than synthetic cases because they reveal whether Planner v2 matches your real operating behavior.

| Field | What to capture |
| --- | --- |
| Snapshot date/time | Exact planning time used for balances, blocks and limits. |
| Selected IPOs | IPO, GMP %, cutoff, allotment date, application mode, manual APPLY/SKIP state. |
| Applicants | PAN alias, priority, demat, active status. |
| Banks/UPIs | Owner, balance, active state, UPI, rolling usage, cross-funding setting. |
| Funding preferences | Beneficiary → preferred banks and order. |
| Recurring debits | Any EMI/other debit before relevant cutoffs. |
| Existing blocks | Amount, IPO, expected release boundary. |
| Expected plan | Applicant → IPO → category → lots → bank → UPI. |
| Expected uncovered rows | Any PAN/IPO that should intentionally remain uncovered. |
| Reason | Why this expected result is correct in business terms. |

# Release gate

- P0: 100% pass required for private beta.

- Golden historical cases: 100% reviewed; differences must be intentional and documented.

- P1: target 100% before invitation beta.

- P2: may be staged, but no known P2 defect may cause wrong cash, duplicate PAN applications or silent override of user locks.

- Planner audit must fail closed: export is blocked when any blocking audit error exists.
